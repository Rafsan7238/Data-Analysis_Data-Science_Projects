# Analysing Alcohol-Related Victorian Road Crashes

The open road, with its promise of freedom and exploration, stands as an emblem of modern society's progress. 
Yet, within the picturesque landscapes and bustling highways of Victoria, a shadow loomsâ€”one that shatters lives, 
families, and communities. This project delves into a pressing concern that gnaws at the heart of road safety: 
alcohol-related crashes. As the wheels of progress turn, so too do the statistics that remind us of the alarming 
intersection between alcohol consumption and road accidents.

## The Project:

Hence, in this project I built a Tableau dashboard to analyse the alcohol-related road crashes in Victoria between 
2015-2019. The project aimed to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to vulnerable groups, crash locations, 
contributing factors, and severity levels.The dataset for this analysis was sourced from the Victorian Government website, 
ensuring reliable and accurate information.
