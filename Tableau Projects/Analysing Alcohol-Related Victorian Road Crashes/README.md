# Analysing Alcohol-Related Victorian Road Crashes

The open road, with its promise of freedom and exploration, stands as an emblem of modern society's progress. 
Yet, within the picturesque landscapes and bustling highways of Victoria, a shadow loomsâ€”one that shatters lives, 
families, and communities. This project delves into a pressing concern that gnaws at the heart of road safety: 
alcohol-related crashes. As the wheels of progress turn, so too do the statistics that remind us of the alarming 
intersection between alcohol consumption and road accidents.

## The Project:

Hence, in this project I built a Tableau dashboard to analyse the alcohol-related road crashes in Victoria between 
2015-2019. The project aimed to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to vulnerable groups, crash locations, 
contributing factors, and severity levels.The dataset for this analysis was sourced from the Victorian Government website, 
ensuring reliable and accurate information.

### Key Insights and Visualizations:

- Vulnerable Groups Analysis:
The dashboard highlights the impact of alcohol-related road crashes on different vulnerable groups based on gender, vehicle type, and individual type. Interactive visualizations offer users the ability to explore and understand how these factors contribute to the prevalence of such incidents.

- Speed Zone Analysis:
The analysis delves into crash data across various speed zones, shedding light on the relationship between alcohol consumption and crash severity in different speed environments.

- Top Suburbs for Alcohol-Related Crashes:
The dashboard identifies and displays the suburbs with the highest incidence of alcohol-related road crashes, giving stakeholders a localized perspective for potential intervention strategies.

- Heat Map Integration:
The integrated heat map displays crash sites across Victoria, offering a visual representation of the distribution of incidents. Additionally, the map overlays liquor shop locations, allowing users to explore any potential correlation between crash sites and proximity to alcohol retail outlets.

- Temporal Analysis:
Users can explore the day of the week and time of day when alcohol-related crashes are most prevalent. This analysis helps identify peak periods and provides insights for targeted enforcement and education efforts.

- Contributing Factors and Severity Analysis:
The dashboard outlines the primary contributing factors behind alcohol-related crashes and categorizes the severity level of the victims. This information aids in understanding the root causes and consequences of these incidents.

- Export Panel:
The dashboard includes a user-friendly export panel that allows users to download the dashboard in both PDF and image formats, facilitating easy sharing and collaboration.

The dashboard provides a comprehensive and visually engaging platform for stakeholders, policy makers, law enforcement agencies, and the general public to comprehend the intricate dynamics of alcohol-related road crashes in Victoria. The insights generated from this analysis can inform evidence-based decision-making, targeted interventions, and awareness campaigns aimed at reducing the occurrence of alcohol-related crashes and promoting road safety.
