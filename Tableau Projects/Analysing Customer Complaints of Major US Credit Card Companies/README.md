# Analysing Customer Complaints of Major US Credit Card Companies

As most people knows, A credit card is a payment card issued to users (cardholders) to enable the cardholder to pay a 
merchant for goods and services based on the cardholder's accrued debt (i.e., promise to the card issuer to pay them for 
the amounts plus the other agreed charges). The card issuer (usually a bank or credit union) creates a revolving account 
and grants a line of credit to the cardholder, from which the cardholder can borrow money for payment to a merchant or as a cash advance.

As time went by, the demand for credit cards just went up. Nowadays, almost everyone has a credit card, instead of a few hundred dollars in their 
wallet. In the USA alone, there are more than 200 financial institutions issuing their users credit cards with various perks. With so many competitors 
out there, it has become imperative for the companies to stay one step ahead in customer satisfaction in order to retain them. Thus, it is neccessary
 for them to manage customer complaints with utmost priority and try to resolve them as soon as they can.
 
 Hence, in this project I have built a customer complaints dashboard for the major US credit card companies. The dashboard gives a quick preview into the 
 total complaints received, the rolling 12 months of complaints, timely responses made and complaints that are in progress for being resolved.
 The trend in complaints can be viewed on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly basis for further analysis of customer satisfaction. The visualisation 
 has been further segregated by states and cities, top 10 issues among clients, the response of the company, and the medium of submission. There is also a calendar 
 view for users to check which days of a particular month had higher or lower amounts of complaints received by the clients.
 
 The dashboard also allows the user to filter the view by year of complaint, company, state, issue and company response. Finally, a user is also able to export the 
 dashboard in pdf format or as an image file.
