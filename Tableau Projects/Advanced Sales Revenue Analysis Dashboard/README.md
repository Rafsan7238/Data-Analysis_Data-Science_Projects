# Advanced Sales Revenue Analysis

A sales dashboard is a tool that enables c-level executives and managers to effectively control sales KPIs and monitor them in one central place while helping teams to reach sales goals through detailed analyses of sales performance, cycle lengths, and sales funnels.

## The Project:

Although I had built a basic sales dashboard before, it did not include a lot of useful KPIs that an executive might wish to visualise to make informed decisions. Hence, in this project, I have created an advanced sales dashboard in Tableau that would give more analytical power to the sales department of a company that would help them to spot their lacking and make necessary changes to hit their predefined goals. 

### Metrics Visualised:

- Total current year sales, profit and quantity
- Total previous year sales, profit and quantity
- Monthly trend in the above KPIs including max and min months
- YOY change sparkline for the above KPIs
- Sales and profit distribution by state on a geographical map
- States having sales and profit below and above the national average
- Monthly sales by audience segments
- Sales by location and manager

The dashboard can be further segregated by:

- Region
- Ship Mode
- Product Category

Finally, the dashboard can be viewed in both light and dark modes as per user preference.

## The Dataset:

### Sales Data:

The data used in this project has been randomly generated and contains more than 10000 records spread across 21 columns, regarding the order, order date, ship date and mode, customer ID and name, customer segment, country and region of order, product ID, category and name, revenue earned from the order, quantity sold, discount given, and the profit made from the sale. 

### Hexmap Data:

It contains the coordinates for the states of the USA to be used for the custom map.
