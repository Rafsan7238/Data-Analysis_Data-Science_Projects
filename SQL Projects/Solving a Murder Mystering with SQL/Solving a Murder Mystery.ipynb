You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on Jan. 15, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City. All the clues to this mystery are buried in a huge database, and you need to use SQL to navigate through this vast network of information. Your first step to solving the mystery is to retrieve the corresponding crime scene report from the police department's database."
