# Analyzing International Debt Statistics with World Bank Data

## Project Description:

It's not that we humans only take debts to manage our necessities. A country may also take debt to manage its economy. For example, infrastructure spending is one costly ingredient required for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/" target="_blank">The World Bank</a> is the organization that provides debt to countries.

In this project, I analyzed international debt data collected by <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/" target="_blank">The World Bank</a>. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. In completing the project, I tried to find the answers to questions like:

- What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
- Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
- What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

## The Dataset:

The data used in this project is provided by <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/" target="_blank">The World Bank</a>. It contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015.

The dataset is in the form of .csv file and contains 2357 rows of debt statistics for 124 countries across the globe. The dataset is structured in the following way:

|	Column	|	Description	|
|---------------|-----------------------|
|	country_name	|	Name of the country	|
|	country_code	|	Code assigned to countries to efficiently distinguish between them	|
|	indicator_name	|	Category of the debt taken from The World Bank	|
|	indicator_code	|	Code assigned to each debt category	|
|	debt	|	Debt owed in USD	|

## Project Tasks:

1. Overview of the 'international\_debt' Table
2. Finding the number of distinct countries
3. Finding out the distinct debt indicators
4. Totaling the amount of debt owed by the countries
5. Country with the highest debt
6. Average amount of debt across indicators
7. The highest amount of principal repayments
8. The most common debt indicator
9. Other viable debt issues and conclusion

## Project Findings:

- There are a total of 124 countries in the dataset. 
- There are a total of 25 unique debt categories that the countries owe. 
- The total debt owed by all the countries is more than 3 million million USD. 
- China owes the highest debt totaling 286 billion USD. 
- The highest average debt the countries owe are in 'Principal repayments on external debt, long-term' and Principal repayments on external debt, private nonguaranteed' categories, averaging more than 5 billion USD each. 
- The most debt owed in 'repayment of long term loans' is by China at 96.22 billion USD, followed by Brazil and Russia at 90.04 and 66.59 billion USD respectively. 
- There are a total of six debt indicators in which all the countries listed in the dataset have taken debt.
- Found out the debt indicators in which each country owes its highest debt.
