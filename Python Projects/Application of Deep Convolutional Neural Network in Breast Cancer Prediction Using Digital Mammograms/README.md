# Application of Deep Convolutional Neural Network in Breast Cancer Prediction Using Digital Mammograms

## Abstract

Cancer, a diagnosis so dreaded and scary, that its fear alone can strike even the
strongest of souls. The disease is often thought of as untreatable and unbearably
painful, with usually, no cure available. Among all the cancers, breast cancer is the
second most deadliest, especially among women. What decides the patientsâ€™ fate
is the early diagnosis of the cancer, facilitating subsequent clinical management.
Mammography plays a vital role in the screening of breast cancers as it can detect
any breast masses or calcifications early. However, the extremely dense breast tissues
pose difficulty in the detection of cancer mass, thus, encouraging the use of machine
learning (ML) techniques and artificial neural networks (ANN) to assist radiologists
in faster cancer diagnosis. This paper explores the MIAS database, containing 332
digital mammograms from women, which were augmented and preprocessed, and
fed into a custom and different pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN)
models, with the aim of differentiating healthy tissues from cancerous ones with
high accuracy. Although the pre-trained CNN models produced splendid results,
the custom CNN model came out on top, achieving test accuracy, AUC, precision,
recall and F1 scores of 0.9362, 0.9407, 0.9200, 0.8025 and 0.8572 respectively while
having minimal to no overfitting. The paper, along with proposing a new custom
CNN model for better breast cancer classification using raw mammograms, focuses
on the significance of computer-aided detection (CAD) models overall in the early
diagnosis of breast cancer. While a diagnosis of breast cancer may still leave patients
dreaded, we believe our research can be a symbol of hope for all.
