# MS-Pathway-Space-Rocks-AI
The repository contains the codes and sample data for classifying space rocks using AI required for a Microsoft Learn Pathway. 

As technology advances, many disciplines outside the field of computer science have found ways to introduce advanced technologies into their work. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a relatively new technology that's being applied to many tasks. From teaching a computer to detect which rock an astronaut should collect based on the type of rock it is to predicting whether a rocket can launch on a specific day, AI can be a useful tool for the brilliant research minds that are behind some of Earth's most inspiring discoveries. 

# What are space rocks?
Before we jump into why we choose to study space rocks, let's first classify the different rocks and soil that NASA scientists study. Rocks and soil from space come in many sizes, ranging from tiny specs of soil found on the Moon to boulders the size of planets that float through space. Boulders that originate in space might be discovered flying through space as meteoroids and asteroids or found on the surface of moons, planets, and even Earth as meteorites.

# Why space rocks are important
When I first started to learn about space rocks, I thought, "Why does NASA keep sending rockets to the Moon to collect space rocks?" (Please don't tell NASA I said that.) Now, I know that space rocks have many uses. In this module, we won't cover all the ways we can use space rocks because of the sheer volume. But for one, rocks tell us about the history of our Solar System as they record geological events, like the eruption of a volcano. Space rocks have been here much longer than humans, and they'll be here long after we are gone.

An example of how we learn about the Solar System by studying space rocks, is the rock type granite. Granite is plentiful on Earth, but our research tells us that granite is rare everywhere else in the Solar System. We know that granite is formed in tectonic regions, where mountains are formed. Many other planets and their moons don't have plate tectonics. This difference between Earth and other parts of the Solar System gives us background information about the current structure of other planets and how the planets were formed.

Along with learning about the history of the Solar System, space rocks can help us in our search to find signs of life or the ability to sustain life other than on Earth. Many rocks in the Universe are water-bearing. If we know a lot about these rocks, we can search for planets that have these rocks. One day, we might find life or an environment with water that can sustain human life.

A final example of what studying space rocks can do for us is that it can help prepare for the future. Although it might seem like a long way off, at some point, we might harvest space rocks as a resource like we gather wood from trees now. Many space rocks have gases and chemical compounds in them that are rare or potentially not found on Earth. In the future, we might use these resources to create new technology that's useful to people on Earth. We might use space rocks to further our exploration of the Solar System, possibly by using them to develop rocket fuel.

# The challenges of collecting space rocks

Astronauts complete a vast array of preparations before going into space. Their top priority is a safe and successful journey to their destination. But one of the main goals of traveling to the Moon is to collect specimens so that we can better understand our Moon and our Solar System. The surface of the Moon is essentially fully covered with potential samples that an astronaut might collect and take back to Earth. And the types of rocks aren't easily identifiable with a glance. 

On the Moon, basalt and highland are common types of rocks; highland rock is the original crust of the Moon. Regolith is a layer of rock and soil that's been broken up by the impact of colliding objects. Another kind of rock found on the Moon is breccia, which is a combination of other rocks smashed together. So, the chemical composition of these rocks may be similar to the original rock types, but they might not be what the astronaut was instructed to collect. 

Being able to identify these rocks on the surface of the Moon, in a space suit, without being to touch the rock, and with less than ideal lighting, makes it even more of a challenge.

# Ways to use AI to improve space rock research

Integrating AI into this process can improve the collection process for both humans and rovers. For example, we could send astronauts to the Moon armed with a computer that can take photos of rocks. The computer could tell the astronaut what type of rock it likely is. The astronaut could then determine if that type of rocks is needed in the collection and decide to take it or not. This computer could also be placed in a rover that could autonomously drive across the surface of the Moon and scan for rocks that we need for research.

By integrating AI, astronauts could more quickly and accurately locate and identify rocks they should bring back to Earth. The computer also could collect metadata like location, temperature, and light exposure. With accuracy feedback from astronauts and scientists on Earth, the AI model used to identify valuable rocks would be improved over time.
