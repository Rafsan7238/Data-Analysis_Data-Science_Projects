# A/B Testing For an E-Commerce Website Ad Marketing

## A/B Testing:

A/B testing, also known as split testing, refers to a randomised experimentation process wherein two or more versions of a variable (web page, ad etc.) are shown to different segments of visitors at the same time to determine which version leaves the maximum impact and drives business metrics. In A/B testing, A refers to ‘control’ or the original testing variable. Whereas B refers to ‘variation’ or a new version of the original testing variable. 

A/B testing helps in finding a better approach to finding customers, marketing products, getting a higher reach, or anything that helps a business convert most of its target customers into actual customers. 

## The Project:

In this project, I have performed an A/B test on two different ad strategies for an E-Commerce company and tried to understand the results obtained from it. The company performed two different campaigns:

- Control Campaign
- Test Campaign

The goal was to help the company decide if they should implement the new ad marketing or stick to the old one in order to get more customers.

## The Dataset:

The datasets (control and test data) used has been collected from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ilkeryildiz/example-dataset-for-ab-test" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> and has been submitted by İlker Yıldız.

**Please note that the use case of the dataset has been changed from its original for the purpose of this project.**

The datasets contained 30 rows of data across 10 columns as follows:

|	Column	|	Description	|
|---------------|-----------------------|
|	Campaign Name	|	The name of the campaign	|
|	Date	|	Date of the record	|
|	Spend [USD]	|	Amount spent on the campaign marketing in dollars	|
|	# of Impressions	|	Number of impressions the ad crossed through the campaign	|
|	Reach	|	The number of unique impressions received in the ad	|
|	# of Website Clicks	|	Number of website clicks received through the ads	|	
|	# of Searches	|	Number of users who performed searches on the website 	|
|	# of View Content	|	Number of users who viewed content and products on the website	|
|	# of Add to Cart	|	Number of users who added products to the cart	|
|	# of Purchase	| 	Number of users who made purchases	|

## Final Findings:

After all the evaluation done on both the campaigns, I have found more sales and engagement from visitors in the control campaign. This campaign had more people viewing products, which ultimately led to more people adding products to cart and more sales.

However, the conversion rate of the products added to cart was remarkably higher in the test campaign. It resulted in more sales with regard to the products viewed and added to the cart, as a higher proportion of people adding products to cart ended up purchasing them, while control generated more sales overall.

## Suggestion:

It might be safe to say, with the current data and analysis, that the test campaign can be used to cater to a specific audience with a specific product, while the control campaign can be used to market multiple general products to a wider audience.
