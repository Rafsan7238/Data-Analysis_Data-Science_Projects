# Multinational Departmental Store Sales Revenue

## Importance of Sales Dashboard
A sales dashboard is a tool that enables c-level executives 
and managers to effectively control sales KPIs and monitor them in 
one central place while helping teams to reach sales goals through 
detailed analyses of sales performance, cycle lengths, and sales funnels.

Sales departments need to have strong ownership of their 
pipelines, data at their fingertips, and accurate information 
at any given point in time. By using modern sales dashboards, 
the performance of the team, sales opportunities, closed deals, 
various other sales KPIs, and sales management on a daily or strategic level become simplified and easier to follow. 

Trying to navigate all the sales tasks while increasing revenue and profits, 
forecasting and comparing data swiftly and accurately is of utmost importance 
for busy bees like sales representatives, managers, and VPs. To have a complete 
360Â° overview of sales information, having real-time data overview in terms of company targets, 
visualizing the progress, and sharing the information with clients or stakeholders, sales 
dashboards will enable full control for the top-level executives.

## The Project:
In this project, I have created a dashboard for a multinational departmental store chain to have a quick glance
at their progress in terms of different KPIs, which will allow them to make necessary adjustments in order to reach
their targets.

### Metrics Visualised:
- Total Revenue by Year
- Total Revenue by Year and Region
- Revenue by Item Category
- Total Revenue and Cost by Region
- Total Revenue by Order Priority
- Revenue by Country

The dashboard can be further segregated by:
- Item Type
- Country
- Region
- Sales Channel
