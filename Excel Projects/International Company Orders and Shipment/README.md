# Orders and Shipment Dashboard for an International E-Commerce Company

## Importance of Orders and Shipment Dashboard
An orders dashboard is a tool that allows a company sales team to analyse their sales performance 
and understand where their revenue generations lie in terms of product categories, customer 
segments, regions etc across various years. This helps them to find a particular area where they 
should focus their sales and marketing efforts to see a better growth of their revenue. 

A shipment dashboard, on the other hand, helps a company monitor their product shipments in terms 
of the products being shipped, order priority, ship mode, regions where shipments are made etc. 
This, in turn, helps them to understand their shipment backlogs, the kind of shipment orders they 
are receiving, where the shipments are going etc to aid in solidifying their supplies.

## The Project:
In this project, I have created a dark-mode dashboard for an international e-commerce company to 
have a quick look at their orders and shipments across different years to allow them to adapt in 
order to reach their goals. 

### Metrics Visualised:
- Total Revenue by Region
- Total Revenue by Year
- Revenue by Item Category
- Revenue by Customer Segment
- Shipments by Order Priority
- Shipments by Ship Mode

The dashboard can be granulised further by:
- Year
- Customer Segment
- Region
