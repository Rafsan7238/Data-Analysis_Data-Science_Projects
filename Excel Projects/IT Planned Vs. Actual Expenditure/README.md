# IT Planned Vs. Actual Expenditure Analysis Dashboard

## What is Plan V Actual Variance?
The plan versus actual comparison is a tool businesses use to measure predictions against real-world results. First, we start by creating a financial forecast, then develop strategies to help ensure that what we predicted occurs. After the event we based our predictions on passes, we review the actual data for variance. "Variance" is the difference between the two data sets, and it gives us an indication of changes we can make in our next prediction to improve results.

## Why Do We Need It?
This analysis is essential to better business management. Thatâ€™s where we track results, review progress, and make regular course corrections depending on performance. 

## What is the Project About?
Hence, in this Excel project, I have created a dashboard for an international IT firm to monitor their expenditures against a planned budget. The main KPIs generated includes the YTD Actual, Plan Vs. Actual Variance YTD, Full Year Forecast, and Full Year Plan Vs. Forecast Variance, where YTD stands for 'year to date'. 

The metrics has been further segregated by the IT Area, Cost Element, Business Area, and Geographical Location to provide specialised visualisations for a deeper insight into the data. The trend and spark lines provide an even better analysis into the moving data over time.

## The Dataset
The dataset used in creating this dashboard is a modified version of the data provided by <a href="obvience.com">Obvience</a>. 

The dataset contains the sales data for an IT firm divided into multiple fields in a table as follows:
| Field       | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Date        | Month of the respective expenditure       |
| Business Area   | Area of business for which the expenditure is recorded        |

| IT Area     | IT categories in the the firm |
| Cost Element Name | Name of the expenditure |
| Actual      | Actual expenditure per month for a particular element |
