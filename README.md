# Data Analysis and Data Science Projects

## What is Data Analytics?

Data Analytics and Data Science is the science of analyzing raw data to make conclusions about that information, and to make inferences and predictions based on the data and statistical evidence. Various approaches to this include looking at what happened (descriptive analytics), why something happened (diagnostic analytics), what is going to happen (predictive analytics), or what should be done next (prescriptive analytics).

## Why is it important?

Data analytics is important because it helps businesses optimize their performances. Implementing it into the business model means companies can help reduce costs by identifying more efficient ways of doing business and by storing large amounts of data. A company can also use data analytics to make better business decisions and help analyze customer trends and satisfaction, which can lead to new and better products and services.
